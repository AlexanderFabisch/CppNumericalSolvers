CppNumericalSolvers (C++11 implementation with MATLAB bindings)
=================================================================

This repository contains some solvers written in C++11 using the [Eigen3][eigen3] library. All implementations were written from scratch. 
You can use this library in **C++ and [Matlab][matlab]** in a simple way.

The library currently contains the following solvers:
- gradient descent solver
- Newton descent solver (c++ only)
- BFGS solver
- L-BFGS solver
- L-BFGS-B solver (c++ only)

Look at the issue list to see recent and planned changes.
Additional helpful functions are

- check gradient
- compute gradient by finite differences
- compute Hessian matrix by finite differences

There is a simple "unittest" inside (minimization of the Rosenbrock function). By convention these solvers minimize a given objective function.

# Usage in C++
First, make sure that you have the [Eigen3][eigen3] in your include paths and your compiler is C++11-ready. To minimze a function it is sufficient to define the objective function as a C++11 functional:

	auto function_value = [] (const Vector &x) -> double {};
	auto gradient_value = [] (const Vector x, Vector &grad) -> void {}; // this definition is optional

If you only implement the objective function then the library will compute a numerical approximation of the gradient. If you want to use `Newton Descent` without explicitly computing the gradient or Hessian matrix you should use `computeGradient`, `computeHessian` from `Meta.h` (check the examples).
To optimize (minimize) the defined objective function you need to select a solver and provide a intial guess:


	Vector x0;                  // initial guess
	LbfgsSolver lbfgs;          // choose a solver

	// solve without explicitly declaring a gradient
	lbfgs.Solve(x0,function_value);

	// or solve with given gradient
	lbfgs.Solve(x0,function_value, gradient_value);

	// or use the Newton method
	auto hessian_value = [&](const Vector x, Matrix & hes) -> void
	{
	    hes = Matrix::Zero(x.rows(), x.rows());
	    computeHessian(function_value, x, hes);
	};
	NewtonDescentSolver newton;      // or use newton descent
	newton.Solve(x0,function_value,gradient_value,hessian_value);


I encourage you to check you gradient once by 

	checkGradient(YOUR-OBJECTIVE-FUNCTION, X, A-SAMPLE-GRADIENT-VECTOR_FROM-YOUR-FUNCTIONAL);

to make sure that there are not mistakes in your objective or gradient function.

## full sample

	int main(void) {

		// create function
		auto rosenbrock = [] (const Vector &x) -> double {
			const double t1 = (1-x[0]);
			const double t2 = (x[1]-x[0]*x[0]);
			return   t1*t1 + 100*t2*t2;
		};

		// create derivative of function
		auto Drosenbrock = [] (const Vector x, Vector &grad) -> void {
			grad[0]  = -2*(1-x[0])+200*(x[1]-x[0]*x[0])*(-2*x[0]);
			grad[1]  = 200*(x[1]-x[0]*x[0]);
		};

		// initial guess
		Vector x0(2);x0 << 1,2;
		// get derivative
		Vector dx0(2);
		Drosenbrock(x0,dx0);
		// verify gradient by finite differences
		checkGradient(rosenbrock,x0,dx0);

		// use solver (GradientDescentSolver,BfgsSolver,LbfgsSolver,LbfgsbSolver)
		LbfgsSolver g;
		g.Solve(x0,rosenbrock,Drosenbrock);

		std::cout << std::endl<<std::endl<< x0.transpose();

		return 0;
	}


# Usage in MATLAB (experimental)
If something goes wrong MATLAB will tell it to you by simply crashing. First, you will need the matlab bindings from the `matlab` branch

There two ways to get this binding by just downloading the archiv file from [github][matlab-binding] or by using git:

	`cd PATH_TO_THIS_LIBRARY` and 
	`git pull origin matlab` and
	`git checkout matlab`

- Download [Eigen][eigen3] and copy the `Eigen` folder into `matlab-bindings`. The compilation script will check if Eigen exists.
- Mex files are no fun! But if your configs are correct ("make.m" will use "-std=c++11") you can run `make` inside the `matlab-bindings` folder. This should create a file `cppsolver.mexw64` or `cppsolver.mexw32`.

To solve your problem just define the objective as a function like

	function y = rosenbrock( x )
	  t1 = (1 - x(1));
	  t2 = (x(2) - x(1) * x(1));
	  y  = t1 * t1 + 100 * t2 * t2; 
	end

an save it under `rosenbrock.m`. If everything is correct you should be able to minimize your function:

	solution = cppsolver([-1;2], @rosenbrock)
	% or if you specify a gradient:
	solution = cppsolver([-1;2], @rosenbrock, 'gradient', @rosenbrock_grad)


If you pass a gradient function the call of the mex-file, it will check the gradient function once in the initial guess to make sure you have no typos in your gradient function. You can skip this check by calling 

	solution=cppsolver([-1;2],@rosenbrock,'gradient',@rosenbrock_grad,'skip_gradient_check','true')


The default solver is `L-BFGS`. To specify another solver you can call

	solution=cppsolver([-1;2],@rosenbrock,'gradient',@rosenbrock_grad,'solver','THE-SOLVER-TYPE')

where you can select a solver from:

- l-bfgs
- bfgs
- gradientdescent

The other solvers have not matlab bindings yet. Hence, it is the experimental version.
There is an example in the folder `matlab-bindings`. The output should be something like

	cppsolver([-1;2],@rosenbrock);
	------------------------------------------------------------
	Found objective function: rosenbrock
	Elapsed time is 0.018334 seconds.


	fminsearch(@rosenbrock,[-1;2]);
	------------------------------------------------------------
	Elapsed time is 0.086369 seconds.


	fminunc(@rosenbrock,[-1;2]);
	------------------------------------------------------------
	Elapsed time is 0.749841 seconds.

Notice, that fminsearch probably use caches if you run this file multiple times.

Rebase - Warning
-----------------
The commit `3122fa1710a0f592b99938ad728c59d787c3077a` was a rebase of the old history to clean things up. Fork this project again, if you have trouble to pull commits. I will never do a rebase on this repository again. I promise.
